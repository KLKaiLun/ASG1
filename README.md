Assignment 1 Idea

I am creating a website for a band which is called "Maroon 5". The purpose of creating this website is to share with the fans and potential fans the band's history, the band members,the band's songs, possibly find out more information about their shows and book tickets for their shows. It is also to help sell more of the band's music or merchandise and getting more gigs.

Some potential features to include in website:

<ul>
    <li>Show band's history and band member names</li>
    <li>Show photos of Band members and photos of albums</li>
    <li>Publicise the band's upcoming shows or tours so that fans are well-informed
    <li>Provide links to the band members' social media profiles</li>
    <li>Show band's merchandise and prices</li>
    <li>Show band's music videos
</ul>
